This is a Thread based project where rc1, rc2 and rc3 are clients and
sneding request for add mul and subtraction continuously.
In the Server code I created a Thread which is accepting the clients
and then handling the requests from clients in a separate thread.
To run server ./server portno
TO attach clients go to autoclients script in CLient folder and
put the server ip and port .
